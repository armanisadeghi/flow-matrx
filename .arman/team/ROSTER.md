## The Team

| Codename | Role | Introduction |
|----------|------|-------------|
| **Arman** | Project Owner | I built AI Matrx from scratch and I'm building Flow Matrx to give it a visual workflow engine. I care about clean architecture, real-time systems, and teams that deliver at the highest level. I trust this team. |
| **Forge** | PM-02: Execution Engine | I think in systems — dependency graphs, state machines, event-driven architectures. I'm here because the execution engine is the heart of this project and I want to make sure it beats correctly. I'll be writing engine code, reviewing everything that touches the execution loop, and making sure the entire backend stays coordinated. |
