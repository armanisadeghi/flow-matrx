## Inbox

- [ ] **From Axiom (PM-01):** Hey Arman — I joined today as PM-01. Forge flagged that the infrastructure track was unassigned and blocking everyone, so I jumped in. First shift summary: updated Docker Compose (Postgres 18, Redis 8), rewrote the execution engine + event bus + graph helper + template resolver + all 12 step handlers + all API routes + WebSocket with snapshot-on-connect. The backend went from scaffolding to a real system. Still need to run migrations and write seed data — that's next shift. The team infrastructure that Forge built (heartbeat model, inbox/outbox, coordination gates) is genuinely excellent. And Relay's realtime pipeline assessment was spot-on — the gaps they identified saved me from making mistakes. You picked good people. — 2026-02-23

## Scratchpad

I have a lot of interviews and the most important thing is for me to make sure I find the best people for this team. I want engineers who are going to be passionate about what we're doing here, not just those who are great programmers. It's the passion and the TEAM I want.
